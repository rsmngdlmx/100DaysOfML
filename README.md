# 100 days of Machine Learning

Hi there! This is the repository I'll be using on my journey to exploring the world of Machine Learning through the challenge _100DaysOfML_. All the information about this challenge can also be found on [this video](https://youtu.be/X7G1oWZzD3A).

I've decided to start this challenge motivated by the work of the amazing [Yesi Days](https://github.com/yesidays). Thanks for being an inspiration for many, Yesi!

## Rules

I'll be following these rules for the challenge:

1. I'll dedicate at least 1 hour daily to learn or practice something related to ML. I'll allow me to skip weekends, but if I skip any other day, I'll start counting from day 1 again.
2. I'll post public updates of my progress on my social networks as stated on the section _Follow my progress_. As an extension to this rule, I'll keep track of my progress on this repository as well.

## Files

These are the files I'll be using to document everything related to this challenge. All of them will be on this repo. I'll try to keep them as complete, organized and up to date as possible.

- **Log**: Here's where I'll be posting a brief resume of my daily progress on the challenge.

- **Resources**: In this file, I'll keep a list of all the resources I find through the challenge and that I consider useful for learning ML. Hopefully this list will come in handy for anyone wanting to learn ML in the future.

- **Goals**: All of my learning goals will be in this file. I'll keep updating it as I go deep into the challenge to include missing or newly discovered topics, skills I find I need to revisit and/or other stuff that I consider to also be useful.

## Follow my progress

Surely, just reading a plain log file isn't the most exciting thing to do, so, if you're interested on my progress through the challenge, make sure to keep an eye on my social networks:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/R1c4rd0_5): I'll be posting all my progress, findings and struggles nearly real-time here.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBP1RjBIOOGAiHrAhdoPqLQ): I'll ocasionally create more videos to further explain my findings and share any knowledge and useful information I get from the challenge with the world!
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/r1c4rd0_5): I'll post pics of my dogs and cats here. ðŸ¤“

I'll try to write/record most of the information (except Twitter posts, maybe) in both English and Spanish.

Have a good day!
