# Log | 100 days of Machine Learning

Here's a day by day overview of my progress on the challenge.

## Day 1 (may 31, 2021)

Today I watched the course [How To Get Started With Machine Learning](https://t.co/PJGrMYes0r?amp=1) by [Santiago (@svpino)](https://twitter.com/svpino).

I loved his recommendation of following a problem-first approach and focus on analysis over code.

I'll follow his proposed study plan and start with Google's [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course).

## Day 2 (june 1st, 2021)

Today I started the course [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) by Google.

I started with the basic concepts on Machine Learning and I continued with the lessons on Linear Regression and Loss.

I'm seriously thinking of doing a review of maths before continuing directly with Machine Learning.

## Day 3 (june 2, 2021)

Due to a shortage of electricity at home, I decided to shift from the course I was taking to the book [Mathematics for Machine Learning by Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://amzn.to/3wzsIeO).

## Day 4 (june 3, 2021)

Today I continued reading [Mathematics for Machine Learning by Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://amzn.to/3wzsIeO).

I started with the chapter on Linear Algebra: I reviewed some characteristics of vectors and then moved to the section on Systems of Linear Equations.

## Day 5 (june 4, 2021)

Today I complemented the book [Mathematics for Machine Learning by Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://amzn.to/3wzsIeO) with some videos on YouTube explaining mathematical closures, vector spaces and even tensors!

## Day 6 (june 7, 2021)

Today I finished the section on systems of linear equations and started the one on matrices. I checked their definition and some general characteristics of matrices.

## Day 7 (june 8, 2021)

Today I put Mathematics aside for a bit to start the book [Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Kearas & TensorFlow by A. GÃ©ron](https://amzn.to/34j6CkN). I reviewed some basic ML concepts once again and checked some ways of classifying ML systems.

# Challenge restart

From this point on, I restarted counting the days from day 1, due to me skipping some days. As I mention on [my video about the challenge](https://youtu.be/X7G1oWZzD3A), every time I skip a day, other than weekends, I will restart counting from day 1.

## Day 1 (june 14, 2021)

I used these days away from the challenge to re-arrange my goals and my study plan for the challenge. As I share with you in [this video](https://youtu.be/AF6u60u1Xzo), I will focus on Math first; then Python; then any ML specific material.

So, for this restart, I went back to the book [Mathematics for Machine Learning by Marc Peter Deisenroth](https://amzn.to/3wzsIeO). I specifically continued with matrices and representing systems of linear equations as matrices and vectors.

## Day 2 (june 15, 2021)

Today I continued reading about matrices: I reviewed basic operations as addition and multiplication and made some exercises. I, then, started reviewing the concepts of inverse and transpose.

## Day 3 (june 16, 2021)

Today I finished reading about the inverse and transpose of a matrix. I also reviewed the multiplication by a scalar.

## Day 4 (june 17, 2021)

Today I finished reviewing the matrix multiplication by a scalar and I continued with the section on solving systems of linear equations.

## Day 5 (june 18, 2021)

I finished the week reviewing the section of solving systems of linear equations using elementary transformations. I made some exercises to beter understand this subject.
