# Log | 100 days of Machine Learning

Here's a day by day overview of my progress on the challenge.

## Day 1

Today I watched the course [How To Get Started With Machine Learning](https://t.co/PJGrMYes0r?amp=1) by [Santiago (@svpino)](https://twitter.com/svpino).

I loved his recommendation of following a problem-first approach and focus on analysis over code.

I'll follow his proposed study plan and start with Google's [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course).
