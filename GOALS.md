# Goals | 100 days of Machine Learning

Here's what I want to achieve with the 100DaysOfML challenge. I will be updating this file often.

## General

I want to cover 3 areas with this challenge:

1. Strenghten my knowledge on the Python programing language.
2. Revisit all the mathematics' core concepts needed for Machine Learning.
3. Learn the fundamentals of Machine Learning.

## My plan

Here's my plan to achieve the points mentioned above (I'll update this as I make progress on the challenge):

- I'll take the course [How To Get Started With Machine Learning](https://t.co/PJGrMYes0r?amp=1) by [Santiago (@svpino)](https://twitter.com/svpino) to have a clearer path on how to get started with ML.
- I'll check out the book [Python Aplicado](https://www.bubok.com.mx/libros/266616/Python-Aplicado) by [Eugenia Bahit @EscuelaBahit](https://twitter.com/EscuelaBahit) as well as other resources to review some of Python's core concepts.
- I'll make a full review of core math concepts used in Machine Learning with the book [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://amzn.to/3wzsIeO) by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong.
- I'll finish the course [Introduction to Machine Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-duke), which I started some weeks ago, to get the fundamentals of Machine Learning.
- I'll support my learning with the book [Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Kearas & TensorFlow](https://amzn.to/34j6CkN) by A. GÃ©ron.
